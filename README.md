AirBnB Clone Project
Overview

This project is an AirBnB Clone developed as part of a learning journey to build a full web application from the ground up. The main goal is to gain hands-on experience in back-end development, front-end integration, and deployment while following industry best practices.

Project Goals

Build a back-end system capable of managing users, properties, and bookings.

Implement a simple front-end to interact with the application.

Practice using Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Gain experience with testing, documentation, and deployment.

Tech Stack

Language: Python

Framework: Django / Flask (depending on progression)

Database: MySQL / SQLite

Version Control: Git & GitHub
Deployment Tools: Docker, CI/CD, and cloud platforms (to be introduced later)
## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
**Responsibilities:**  
- Implement API endpoints for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.  
- Develop the business logic and integrate with the database.  
- Ensure proper authentication, authorization, and data validation.  
- Work closely with the Database Administrator and DevOps Engineer to optimize backend performance and deployment.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
**Responsibilities:**  
- Design and manage the PostgreSQL database schema for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.  
- Implement indexing and caching strategies to optimize data retrieval and performance.  
- Monitor database health, perform backups, and manage migrations.  
- Collaborate with the Backend Developer to ensure efficient and scalable data storage.

### DevOps Engineer
**Responsibilities:**  
- Set up, configure, and maintain deployment pipelines (CI/CD) for automated testing and deployment.  
- Manage containerization using Docker for consistent development and production environments.  
- Monitor backend services and ensure scalability and reliability.  
- Handle server provisioning, cloud configurations, and integration with Redis and Celery for asynchronous tasks.

### QA Engineer
**Responsibilities:**  
- Develop and execute test plans to ensure the backend meets functional and performance requirements.  
- Test API endpoints for correctness, reliability, and security.  
- Report bugs and collaborate with the Backend Developer and DBA to fix issues.  
- Ensure that all features meet quality standards before release.
## Technology Stack

- üêç **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the Airbnb Clone. It handles server-side logic, routing, and integration with the database, providing a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs.  

- ‚ö° **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, permissions, and request handling, making backend development faster and more secure.  

- üóÑÔ∏è **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. Supports complex queries, indexing, and ensures data integrity.  

- üìä **GraphQL**: A flexible query language and runtime that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It improves efficiency by reducing over-fetching and provides a single endpoint for accessing multiple resources.  

- üìù **Celery**: A distributed task queue for handling asynchronous and scheduled tasks. In this project, Celery is used to process background jobs such as sending email notifications and handling payment processing.  

- üß© **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache and message broker. It helps improve performance by storing frequently accessed data and supporting Celery task queues.  

- üê≥ **Docker**: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into a container. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.  

- üîÑ **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying code. This ensures that new features or bug fixes are delivered safely, quickly, and reliably.  
## Database Design (ERD)

### **How this works:**
- `PK` = Primary Key  
- `FK` = Foreign Key  
- `1` and `*` indicate the relationship: one-to-many (*1 user can have many bookings*)

### **How to add to README.md**
1. Open `README.md` on GitHub.  
2. Click the **pencil icon** to edit.  
3. Scroll to where you want the ERD and **paste the code block above**.  
4. Commit changes with a message like `Add ERD diagram for Database Design`.  

‚úÖ This gives your README a **visual representation** of the database structure without needing an image.  

If you want, I can **also create a slightly cleaner, more compact version** of this ERD so it fits nicely in the README without taking too much space.  

Do you want me to do that?
