AirBnB Clone Project
Overview

This project is an AirBnB Clone developed as part of a learning journey to build a full web application from the ground up. The main goal is to gain hands-on experience in back-end development, front-end integration, and deployment while following industry best practices.

Project Goals

Build a back-end system capable of managing users, properties, and bookings.

Implement a simple front-end to interact with the application.

Practice using Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Gain experience with testing, documentation, and deployment.

Tech Stack

Language: Python

Framework: Django / Flask (depending on progression)

Database: MySQL / SQLite

Version Control: Git & GitHub
Deployment Tools: Docker, CI/CD, and cloud platforms (to be introduced later)
## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
**Responsibilities:**  
- Implement API endpoints for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.  
- Develop the business logic and integrate with the database.  
- Ensure proper authentication, authorization, and data validation.  
- Work closely with the Database Administrator and DevOps Engineer to optimize backend performance and deployment.

### Database Administrator (DBA)

- Implement indexing and caching strategies to optimize data retrieval and performance.  
- Monitor database health, perform backups, and manage migrations.  
- Collaborate with the Backend Developer to ensure efficient and scalable data storage.

### DevOps Engineer
**Responsibilities:**  
- Set up, configure, and maintain deployment pipelines (CI/CD) for automated testing and deployment.  
- Manage containerization using Docker for consistent development and production environments.  
- Monitor backend services and ensure scalability and reliability.  
- Handle server provisioning, cloud configurations, and integration with Redis and Celery for asynchronous tasks.

### QA Engineer
**Responsibilities:**  
- Develop and execute test plans to ensure the backend meets functional and performance requirements.  
- Test API endpoints for correctness, reliability, and security.  
- Report bugs and collaborate with the Backend Developer and DBA to fix issues.
