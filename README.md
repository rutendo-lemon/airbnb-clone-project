## Technology Stack

- üêç **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the Airbnb Clone. It handles server-side logic, routing, and integration with the database, providing a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs.  

- ‚ö° **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, permissions, and request handling, making backend development faster and more secure.  

- üóÑÔ∏è **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. Supports complex queries, indexing, and ensures data integrity.  

- üìä **GraphQL**: A flexible query language and runtime that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It improves efficiency by reducing over-fetching and provides a single endpoint for accessing multiple resources.  

- üìù **Celery**: A distributed task queue for handling asynchronous and scheduled tasks. In this project, Celery is used to process background jobs such as sending email notifications and handling payment processing.  

- üß© **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache and message broker. It helps improve performance by storing frequently accessed data and supporting Celery task queues.  

- üê≥ **Docker**: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into a container. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.  

- üîÑ **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying code. This ensures that new features or bug fixes are delivered safely, quickly, and reliably.  

## Database Design

The Airbnb Clone backend will use a relational database (PostgreSQL) with the following key entities:

### **1. Users**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `name`  
- `email` (unique)  
- `password`  
- `phone_number`  

**Relationships:**  
- A user can have multiple bookings.  
- A user can leave multiple reviews.  
- A user can own multiple properties if they are a host.  

---

### **2. Properties**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `title`  
- `description`  
- `price_per_night`  
- `location`  
- `host_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)  

**Relationships:**  
- A property belongs to a user (host).  
- A property can have multiple bookings.  
- A property can have multiple reviews.  

---

### **3. Bookings**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key referencing Properties)  
- `check_in_date`  
- `check_out_date`  
- `status` (e.g., confirmed, canceled)  

**Relationships:**  
- A booking belongs to one user and one property.  

---

### **4. Reviews**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key referencing Properties)  
- `rating` (e.g., 1-5 stars)  
- `comment`  

**Relationships:**  
- A review belongs to one user and one property.  
- A property can have multiple reviews from different users.  

---

### **5. Payments**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key referencing Bookings)  
- `amount`  
- `payment_date`  
- `payment_status` (e.g., completed, pending, failed)  

**Relationships:**  
- A payment is associated with a single booking.  
- A booking can have one or multiple payments depending on the payment system.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  This feature allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. It ensures that each user has a personalized experience and can interact with properties, bookings, and reviews.  

- **Property Management**  
  Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature allows properties to be showcased with detailed descriptions, pricing, and location information for potential guests.  

- **Booking System**  
  Users can make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out dates. This system ensures that reservations are handled efficiently and accurately, preventing double-bookings.  

- **Payment Processing**  
  Handles transactions related to bookings in a secure and reliable manner. This feature records payment details and tracks the status of each payment, ensuring smooth financial operations for hosts and guests.  

- **Review System**  
  Allows users to post and manage reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature helps build trust and transparency between hosts and guests by providing feedback and insights.  

- **API Documentation**  
  Detailed documentation of REST and GraphQL APIs ensures that developers can easily integrate with the backend. This feature improves clarity, reduces errors, and facilitates collaboration.  

- **Database Optimizations**  
  Implements indexing and caching strategies to improve performance and reduce database load. This ensures efficient data retrieval for frequently accessed information such as properties and bookings.  

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, ensure privacy, and maintain trust in the Airbnb Clone platform. The following key security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**  
  Users must log in using secure credentials before accessing protected endpoints. This ensures that only registered users can perform actions such as booking properties or posting reviews.  

- **Authorization**  
  Access to resources is controlled based on user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). This prevents users from performing unauthorized actions, such as editing someone else‚Äôs property or booking.  

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Limits the number of requests a user or client can make in a given time frame. This helps prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and ensures the backend remains available and performant.  

- **Data Encryption**  
  Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest. This protects user information from being intercepted or compromised.  

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
  All inputs from users are validated and sanitized to prevent attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This ensures data integrity and protects the backend from malicious requests.  

- **Logging & Monitoring**  
  Security-related events, such as failed login attempts or suspicious activity, are logged and monitored. This allows for early detection of potential threats and faster incident response.  
## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. They ensure that new features or bug fixes are delivered safely, quickly, and reliably, reducing the risk of errors in production.  

For the Airbnb Clone project, CI/CD pipelines help maintain a stable backend by automatically running tests on API endpoints, building Docker containers, and deploying updates to the server.  

**Tools that can be used:**  
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for testing and deployment directly from the repository.  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent application environments across development, testing, and production.  
- **Celery & Redis**: Supports asynchronous task management as part of the deployment workflow.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Works seamlessly in the pipeline with migrations and database versioning.  

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures higher code quality, faster delivery, and a more reliable backend for users and hosts.
