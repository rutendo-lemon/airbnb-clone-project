# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project provides a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. It mimics the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for both users and hosts. The backend is built using Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Celery, Redis, and Docker, with automated CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment.

## Team Roles

- üë®‚Äçüíª **Backend Developer**:  
  Responsible for implementing API endpoints for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews. Develops business logic, ensures proper authentication and authorization, and integrates with the database. Works closely with the DBA and DevOps Engineer to optimize backend performance and deployment.  

- üóÑÔ∏è **Database Administrator (DBA)**:  
  Designs and manages the PostgreSQL database schema. Implements indexing and caching strategies for fast data retrieval, monitors database health, performs backups, and handles migrations. Collaborates with the Backend Developer to ensure efficient and scalable data storage.  

- ‚öôÔ∏è **DevOps Engineer**:  
  Sets up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Manages Docker containerization to ensure consistent environments across development and production. Monitors backend services for scalability and reliability. Handles server provisioning and integration with Redis and Celery for asynchronous tasks.  

- üß™ **QA Engineer**:  
  Develops and executes test plans to ensure backend functionality meets requirements. Tests API endpoints for correctness, security, and reliability. Reports bugs and collaborates with the Backend Developer and DBA to fix issues. Ensures all features meet quality standards before release.

## Technology Stack

- üêç **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the Airbnb Clone. Handles server-side logic, routing, and integration with the database, providing a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs.  

- ‚ö° **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Simplifies building RESTful APIs with tools for serialization, authentication, permissions, and request handling.  

- üóÑÔ∏è **PostgreSQL**: Stores and manages user profiles, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. Supports complex queries, indexing, and ensures data integrity.  

- üìä **GraphQL**: Flexible query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and providing a single endpoint for multiple resources.  

- üìù **Celery**: Handles asynchronous and scheduled tasks like sending notifications or processing payments.  

- üß© **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching and as a message broker to improve performance and support Celery task queues.  

- üê≥ **Docker**: Containerization platform that ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.  

- üîÑ **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate testing, building, and deployment to ensure safe and reliable code delivery.

## Database Design

### Key Entities

- **Users**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `phone_number`  
  - A user can have multiple bookings, reviews, and properties (if a host).  

- **Properties**: `id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location`, `host_id`  
  - Belongs to a user (host) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.  

- **Bookings**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, `status`  
  - Belongs to one user and one property.  

- **Reviews**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
  - Belongs to one user and one property; a property can have many reviews.  

- **Payments**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `payment_status`  
  - Associated with a single booking; a booking can have one or multiple payments.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying code changes. They ensure new features or bug fixes are delivered safely, quickly, and reliably.  

**Tools:**  
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for testing and deployment.  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.  
- **Celery & Redis**: Supports asynchronous task management.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Works with migrations and database versioning as part of the pipeline.  

Implementing CI/CD ensures higher code quality, faster delivery, and a reliable backend for users and hosts.
