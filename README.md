## Technology Stack

- üêç **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the Airbnb Clone. It handles server-side logic, routing, and integration with the database, providing a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs.  

- ‚ö° **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, permissions, and request handling, making backend development faster and more secure.  

- üóÑÔ∏è **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. Supports complex queries, indexing, and ensures data integrity.  

- üìä **GraphQL**: A flexible query language and runtime that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It improves efficiency by reducing over-fetching and provides a single endpoint for accessing multiple resources.  

- üìù **Celery**: A distributed task queue for handling asynchronous and scheduled tasks. In this project, Celery is used to process background jobs such as sending email notifications and handling payment processing.  

- üß© **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache and message broker. It helps improve performance by storing frequently accessed data and supporting Celery task queues.  

- üê≥ **Docker**: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into a container. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.  

- üîÑ **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying code. This ensures that new features or bug fixes are delivered safely, quickly, and reliably.  

## Database Design

The Airbnb Clone backend will use a relational database (PostgreSQL) with the following key entities:

### **1. Users**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `name`  
- `email` (unique)  
- `password`  
- `phone_number`  

**Relationships:**  
- A user can have multiple bookings.  
- A user can leave multiple reviews.  
- A user can own multiple properties if they are a host.  

---

### **2. Properties**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `title`  
- `description`  
- `price_per_night`  
- `location`  
- `host_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)  

**Relationships:**  
- A property belongs to a user (host).  
- A property can have multiple bookings.  
- A property can have multiple reviews.  

---

### **3. Bookings**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key referencing Properties)  
- `check_in_date`  
- `check_out_date`  
- `status` (e.g., confirmed, canceled)  

**Relationships:**  
- A booking belongs to one user and one property.  

---

### **4. Reviews**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key referencing Properties)  
- `rating` (e.g., 1-5 stars)  
- `comment`  

**Relationships:**  
- A review belongs to one user and one property.  
- A property can have multiple reviews from different users.  

---

### **5. Payments**
**Key Fields:**  
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key referencing Bookings)  
- `amount`  
- `payment_date`  
- `payment_status` (e.g., completed, pending, failed)  

**Relationships:**  
- A payment is associated with a single booking.  
- A booking can have one or multiple payments depending on the payment system.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  This feature allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. It ensures that each user has a personalized experience and can interact with properties, bookings, and reviews.  

- **Property Management**  
  Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature allows properties to be showcased with detailed descriptions, pricing, and location information for potential guests.  

- **Booking System**  
  Users can make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out dates. This system ensures that reservations are handled efficiently and accurately, preventing double-bookings.  

- **Payment Processing**  
  Handles transactions related to bookings in a secure and reliable manner. This feature records payment details and tracks the status of each payment, ensuring smooth financial operations for hosts and guests.  

- **Review System**  
  Allows users to post and manage reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature helps build trust and transparency between hosts and guests by providing feedback and insights.  

- **API Documentation**  
  Detailed documentation of REST and GraphQL APIs ensures that developers can easily integrate with the backend. This feature improves clarity, reduces errors, and facilitates collaboration.  

- **Database Optimizations**  
  Implements indexing and caching strategies to improve performance and reduce database load. This ensures efficient data retrieval for frequently accessed information such as properties and bookings.
